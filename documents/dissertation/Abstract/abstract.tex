\end{center}
Ant Colony Optimisation algorithms are a commonly used family of swarm intelligence methods. The underlying concepts of such algorithms can be difficult to comprehend for people who have recently come across the subject area. The majority of existing applications that visualise such algorithms either inadequately do so or rely on the user having some prior knowledge about the underlying behaviours in order to fully utilise the application. The author of this project aims to create an application for deployment in educational environments allowing for a richer, more interactive experience in regards to the teaching of Ant Colony Optimisation methods. The author has set out to achieve a full visual representation of the algorithms execution whilst also providing an intuitive user interfaceenabling user defined algorithm parameters and a choice of algorithm types and modifiers.
