\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Neil MacParthalain who has provided incredible help throughout the projects development. I appreciate the time he has spent with me at various times which has allowed me to develop a greater understanding the underlying algorithm behaviours. I would also like to thank Neil Taylor who has been very informative in regards to what is expected from a major project. My appreciation also goes to everyone involved with the department of Computer Science at Aberystwyth University for proving the resources necessary for the completion of a successful project such as this.

My Thanks is also expressed to my fellow final year students, especially Thomas Keogh, for spending many hours in the Delphinium over the course of the projects development enabling the countless hours spent testing and debugging much more enjoyable. Finally I would like to thank my mother Diane, father Paul and brother Michael for continued support and motivation throughout my degree.

\section*{Abstract}

Ant Colony Optimisation and its variations are commonly used swarm intelligence methods, however the underlying concepts can be difficult to comprehend for people who have recently come across the subject area. The majority of existing resources either inadequate visual representations or rely on the user having some prior knowledge about the underlying behaviours. The author of this project aims to create an application for deployment in educational environments allowing for a richer, more interactive experience in regards to the teaching of Ant Colony Optimisation methods. The author has set out to achieve a full visual representation of the algorithm's execution as well as providing an intuitive user interface allowing for user defined algorithm parameters and a choice of algorithm types and modifiers.
