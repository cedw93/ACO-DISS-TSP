I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Neil MacParthalain who has provided incredible help throughout the projects development. I appreciate the time he has spent with me at various times which has allowed me to develop a greater understanding the underlying algorithm behaviours. I would also like to thank Neil Taylor who has been very informative in regards to what is expected from a major project. My appreciation also goes to everyone involved with the department of Computer Science at Aberystwyth University for proving the resources necessary for the completion of a successful project such as this.

My Thanks is also expressed to my fellow final year students, especially Thomas Keogh, for spending many hours in the Delphinium over the course of the projects development enabling the countless hours spent testing and debugging much more enjoyable. Finally I would like to thank my mother Diane, father Paul and brother Michael for continued support and motivation throughout my degree.
