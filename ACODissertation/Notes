Singletons were discarded from GUI, deemed unnecessary for this content upon actually implementing the GUI code.
	- current set up means its easy to ensure only 1 instance
	- system is not large or complex enough

	was going to use JSlider for use values, but it doesn't not make it easy to handle decimal values.
	
	alpha and beta need to be limited to 0-1
	
	added MVC using Observer/observable
	
	original frame dimensions were 1300 x 900 this has been reduced to 1300 x 700 in order to run on a more standard screens size
		- result of this means the game area is now 40x30 rather than 40x40
		
------------------------
Had to re evaluated the problem, changed to TSP representation:

code adpated from: https://code.google.com/p/antcolonyopt/ by Thomas Jungblut

distance matrix holds the distance from a city n to another city x
	- this is a 2d array where the first index is the city you are at
	- the second index is the city you want the distance to
		- e.g. distanceMatrix[4][15] will contain the distance from node 4 to node 15

inverted distance matrix is similar to the above but each index has been inverted (1/index) in order for use in the probability function

same with pheromones

The code used for the algorithm is a combination of modification and reuse of the algorithm provided by Thomas Jungblut in order to model the algorithm as well as completely my own code for the GUI elements.

potentially using linear  interpolation to render ants so they move on the lines rather than teleporting to a city
